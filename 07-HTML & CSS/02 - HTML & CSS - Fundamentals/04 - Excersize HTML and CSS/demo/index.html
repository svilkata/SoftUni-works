            <h1>Warp Drive</h1>
        </header>

        <p>A <strong>warp drive</strong> or a drive enabling space warp is a fictional superluminal spacecraft
            propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably Star Trek,[1] and a subject of ongoing physics
            research. The general concept of "warp drive" was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel Islands
            of Space and was popularized by the Star Trek series. Its closest real-life equivalent is the Alcubierre
            drive, a theoretical solution of the field equations of general relativity.[2]</p>

        <p>Warp drive, or a drive enabling space warp, is one of several ways of travelling through space found in
            science fiction.[3] It has been often discussed as being conceptually similar to hyperspace.[3][4]: 238–239 
            A warp drive is a device that distorts the shape of the space-time continuum.[5]: 142  A spacecraft equipped
            with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude. In contrast
            to some other fictitious faster-than-light technologies such as a jump drive, the warp drive does not permit
            instantaneous travel and transfers between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time
            which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperspace, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to
            interact with objects in "normal space".[6][7]</p>

        <h2>Star Trek</h2>

        <p>Warp drive is one of the fundamental features of the Star Trek franchise; and one of the best-known examples
            of space warp (warp drive) in fiction.[3] In the first pilot episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, "The
            Cage", it is referred to as a "hyperdrive", with Captain Pike stating the speed to reach planet Talos IV as
            "time warp, factor 7". The warp drive in Star Trek is one of the most detailed fictional technologies there
            is.[citation needed] Compared to the hyperspace drives of other fictional universes, it differs in that a
            spaceship does not leave the normal space-time continuum and instead the space-time itself is distorted, as
            is made possible in the general theory of relativity.[7]</p>

        </ol>


        <p>The basic functional principle of the warp drive in Star Trek is the same for all spaceships. A strong energy
            source, usually a so-called warp core or sometimes called intermix chamber, generates a high-energy plasma.
            This plasma is transported to the so-called warp field generators via lines that are reminiscent of pipes.
            These generators are basically coils in warp nacelles protruding from the spaceship. These generate a
            subspace field, the so-called warp field or a warp bubble, which distort space-time and propels the bubble
            and spaceship in the bubble forward.[17]</p>

        <p>The warp core can be designed in various forms. Humans and most of the other fictional races use a moderated
            reaction of antideuterium and deuterium with so called Dilithium. The Romulans, for example, use artificial
            micro-black holes called quantum singularity.[18]</p>

        <p>The speeds are given in warp factors and follow a Geometric progression. The first scale developed by Franz
            Joseph was simply a cubic progression with no limit.[19] This leads to the use of ever growing warp factors
            in the Original Series and the Animated Series. For example, warp 14.1 in the TOS-episode "That Which
            Survives" or warp 36 in the TAS-episode "The Counter-Clock Incident". In order to focus more on the story
            and away from the technobabble, Gene Roddenberry commissioned Michael Okuda to invent a revised warp scale.
            Warp 10 should be the absolute limit and stand for infinite speed. In homage to Gene Roddenberry, this limit
            was also called "Eugene's Limit". Okuda explains this in an author's comment in his technical manual for the
            USS Enterprise-D.[20] Between Warp 1 (the speed of light) and Warp 9, the increase was still roughly
            geometric, but the exponent was adjusted so that the speeds were higher compared to the old scale. For
            instance, Warp 9 is more than 1500 times faster than Warp 1 in comparison to the 729 times (nine to the
            power of 3) calculated using the original cubic formula. In the same author's comment, Okuda explains that
            the motivation was to fulfill fan expectations that the new Enterprise is much faster than the original, but
            without changing the warp factor numbers.[20] Between Warp 9 and Warp 10, the new scale grows
            exponentially.[20] Only in a single episode of Star Trek Voyager there was a specific numerical speed value
            given for a warp factor. In the episode "The 37's", Tom Paris tells Amelia Earhart that Warp 9.9 is about 4
            billion miles per second (using customary units for the character's benefit).[21] That is more than 14 times
            the value of Warp 9 and equal to around 21,400 times speed of light. However, this statement contradicts the
            technical manuals and encyclopedias written by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda. There a speed of 3053 times
            the speed of light was established for a warp factor of 9.9 and a speed of 7912 times the speed of light for
            a warp factor of 9.99. Both numerical values are well below the value given by Tom Paris.[22]</p>

        <h3>Modified warp scale - The Next Generation = Deep Space Nine and Voyager</h3>

        <p>In the episode "Vis à Vis", a coaxial warp drive is mentioned. The working principle is explained in more
            detail in the Star Trek Encyclopedia. This variant of a warp drive uses spatial folding instead of a warp
            field and allows an instant movement with nearly infinite velocity.[23]</p>

        <p>Star Trek has also introduced a so-called Transwarp concept, but without a fixed definition.[22] It is
            effectively a catch-all phrase for any and all technologies and natural phenomena that enable speeds above
            Warp 9.99.[24]</p>
